"""
STATEMENT
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

CLARIFICATIONS
- Can we assume that there is no duplicate in the array? Yes.

EXAMPLES
(needs to be drawn)

COMMENTS
- The two base cases are empty list, which transforms into None, and single element list, which
  transforms into a TreeNode.
- Then, recursively, the root is the node with (n/2)th value, and then we can recursively call
  the left and right subtree.
