"""
STATEMENT
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path
such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

CLARIFICATIONS
-

EXAMPLES
(needs to be drawn)

COMMENTS
- A recursive solution over the left and right subtree should work.
- The base cases are tricky, since we need to track both None and when the
  sum finishes.
