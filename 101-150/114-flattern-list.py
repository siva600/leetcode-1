"""
STATEMENT
Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

CLARIFICATIONS
- Does the order in the linked list matter? Technically it should not, but
  leetcode OJ cares about a DFS-oriented order.

EXAMPLES
(needs to be drawn)

COMMENTS
- We run a vanilla DFS and store all the values in a list.
- Then we reconstruct the tree in-place.
- Both time and space complexity are linear in size of the tree.
